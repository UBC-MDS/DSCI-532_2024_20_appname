## Milestone 2: Reflection

We implemented all but 1 figure from our initial proposal (i.e., CO2 emission per capita). Our current dashboard includes 2 widgets that filter for year range of interest as well as countries of interest, as well as 4 outputs: (1) total emission over the year range / countries selected, (2) a world map where colour intensity is proportional to the amount of CO2 emitted in the selected year range, (3) a complementary bar chart showing up to the top 10 countries with the highest emissions among countries selected, and (4) a trend graph plotting change in temperature against CO2 emission for countries and years selected. We believe these are a good starting point for providing our target users with enough information to gain a general understanding of this dataset.

Our current implementation of the dashboard deviated from the layout in our initial proposal. Specifically, we played around with the layout and found that the current arrangement of widgets and graphs makes for a much smoother user experience. That is, having the most important information at the top (KPI: total CO2 emission) and on the left hand side (heat map by CO2 emission) of the dashboard, as this is what we want our audience to focus on. Since the amount of CO2 emitted might be too large a number for users to conceptualize, we also added a "fun fact" to help them conceptualize the number more concretely. 

For the bar charts, we chose to deliberately deviate from the best practice of having the largest values closest to the x-axis. This is because typically, the most important information is presented at the top, and that is what most audience is used to and what they expect to see. Furthermore, what we want the audience to focus on is the magnitude of the difference between countries and less so the actual values in this case.

Currently, one limitation we have not yet had time to address is the lag time between changing the filter options (year range especially) and the graph updating. This significantly hinders the user experience and is something we would like to address in future iterations. In addition, we are also aware that heat map values do not remain stable, which makes comparison across year range and/or countries (depending on which ones were selected) challenging.
