## Section 1: Motivation and purpose



## Section 2: Description of the data
The dataset we will be visualizing contains approximately 50,000 rows of CO2, energy consumption, and general population data spanning 264 countries. There is one data point per location per year between as early as 1750 until 2022. The dataset contains 79 features, however it is important to note that only 1200 of the rows contain values for all 79 features. We will focus on visualizing features with fewer missing values, and discuss the best strategies for imputation where needed.
We think the following features are of particular interest for creating insightful visualizations that demonstrate how a countryâ€™s size and wealth relate to its impact on climate change: <br>
* `co2` which contains the total CO2 emission in a given year for a given country
* `temperature_change_from_co2` which contains the temperature change due to CO2 in a given year for a given country
* `co2_per_capita` which describes the CO2 emission per capita in a given year for a given country
* Information related to country demographics such as `country`, `population`, and `gdp` 


All of the features selected above have at least 30,000 non-null entries. Another feature that would be interesting for visualization would be the total global mean temperature change for a given year, which we can get by adding the individual temperature change contribution columns, or derive using another data source such as  NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.


## Section 3: Research questions


## Section 4: App sketch and description

Below is a sketch of our proposed dashboard.

![sketch](../img/sketch.png)

Our proposed dashboard comprises two parts. At the top, we provide our users with general statistics regarding the total CO2 emission for any given year, which can be adjusted by the toggle bar on the top left hand side. Based on this information, we can also see the top 10 countries in order of CO2 emission at a given point in time (as measured by cumulative CO2 emission up until that year), as well as the CO2 emission per capita for that specific year. Note that the default is set to the most recent year in which data is available (i.e., 2022).

At the bottom, the dashboard provides users with a way to explore the data for a given country in more detail. By default, the map shows the degree of CO2 emission by country on a colour scale, and next to it, the cumulative CO2 emission over time (orange line) as well as the change in average global temperature across the same time frame for reference (dotted blue line). Note that the latter does not change, as it serves as a meausre of global temperature change over time. By clicking on a specific country (e.g., Canada), the user will be able to see its specific cumulative CO2 emission over time.
